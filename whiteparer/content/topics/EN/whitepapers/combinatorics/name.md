### Name

"Combinatorics" is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arranging, and combining objects or elements in various ways. It involves studying the different ways in which a set of objects.

The name of our project was chosen because our systems are composed of standard modules that can be combined to create various devices. Most importantly, increasing the number of modules leads to a geometric progression in the number of possible devices.
