### Combinator  Framework

Combinator is an industrial framework composed of individual electronic modules (power modules, motor control modules,
sensors, etc.). Like building with Lego blocks, these modules can be assembled to create diverse projects across various
industrial sectors, embodying the essence of convergence.

**Combinator** is an industrial framework consisting of various types of elements:

- Basic electronic modules with a standard interface
- FPGA-based hubs that bring the modules together into a unified system
- Standard connectors
- Standard motors
- Sensors

With these elements, you can create various robotic systems, much like assembling Lego blocks, from completely different
industrial sectors. The more basic modules you have, the more equipment variations you can create.

### Name

"Combinator" reflects our project's focus on modularity and flexibility. Just as Combinatorics in mathematics explores different ways to count, arrange, and combine objects, our system allows the combination of standard modules to create various devices. The name emphasizes our core idea: combining modules to unlock numerous possibilities. Increasing the number of modules leads to a geometric progression in potential devices, showcasing the power of combinatorial creativity in technology.
